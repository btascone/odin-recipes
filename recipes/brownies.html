        <h2>Easy Fudgie Brownies</h2>
        <p>This is my absolute favorite brownie recipe. They are rich, fudgy in the middle, and made completely from scratch. These
        homemade brownies are so much better than the box, and I bet you have what you need to make them already sitting in your
        kitchen.</p>
        <p>I Know that saying these are the “best brownies, ever” is a bold statement, but we truly believe it. I love brownies that
        are rich and extra chocolaty. These brownies with dense, fudgy middles and crinkly tops absolutely deliver! These are
        perfect for boxed brownie lovers — the dense, moist, and fudgy texture is not all that different from what you can
        expect from the boxed mixes. It get’s better, though. These brownies are much more flavorful than anything made from a
        box. They taste amazing.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>10 tablespoons (145 grams) unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups (250 grams) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (80 grams) unsweetened cocoa powder, <em>natural, or dutch-process</em></li>
            <li>1/4 rounded teaspoon kosher salt, <em>use slightly less if using fine sea or table salt</em></li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 large cold eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (65 grams) all purpose flour</li>
            <li>2/3 cup (75 grams) chopped walnuts or pecans, optional</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 325 degrees F. Line the bottom and sides of an 8-inch x
            8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil, leaving an overhang on opposite sides to help remove the
            baked brownies from the pan.</li>
            <li>Prepare a double-boiler by filling a medium saucepan with water about 2 inches deep. Heat the water until barely
            simmering.</li>
            <li>Combine the butter, sugar, cocoa powder, and salt in a medium heat-safe bowl. Rest the bowl over the simmering water. If
            the bottom of the bowl touches the water, remove a little water from the saucepan.</li>
            <li>Stir the mixture occasionally until the butter has melted and the mixture is quite warm. Don’t worry if it looks gritty;
            it will become smooth once you add the eggs and flour.</li>
            <li>Remove the bowl from the saucepan, and set aside for 5 minutes or until it is only warm, not hot.</li>
            <li>stir in the vanilla.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, stirring vigorously after each one.</li>
            <li>When the batter looks thick and well blended, add the flour. Use a spoon to beat the flour into the batter until it is
            very thick and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. We use a wooden spoon or spatula and beat for 40 to 50 strokes</li>
            <li>stir in nuts if using.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Bake Brownies</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>spread batter evenly in the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake the brownies until the edges look dry and the middle looks slightly underbaked; 20 to 30 minutes. You can test
            doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center. The brownies are finished baking if it comes out with a few moist
            crumbs attached.</li>
            <li>cool completely before removing from the pan</li>
            <li>cut into 16 squares</li>
        </ol>
